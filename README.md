ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Carlos and this is @EmptyShop, my first (but not the last) repository.
I feel very happy coding C#, JavaScript and Kotlin projects.
Also, I'm interested in gaining experience in other languages and platforms. Who knows, maybe I'll invent my own language ðŸ˜Ž

That's all for now. Thanks for reading. âœŒ
